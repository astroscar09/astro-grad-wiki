# General Info

As of 2024-2025, all GRAs & TAs make \$3,083/month (\$2,899 post-tax). People on fellowships may make more. All health insurance, tuition, and student fees are paid for by the department if you are a RA. If you are on Fellowship you are responsible for getting your own health insurance but the department normally gives you \$2000 to cover this expense. 

In general, grad students living alone in studios or 1 bedroom apartments pay between \$900 - \$1300. UT University Apartments has studios/1 bedrooms for ~$1100 which includes wifi. Grad students living with a partner in a 1 bedroom pay up to \$1650 for nicer apartments.

## Free Realtors

Many grads recommend using a free realtor company to find an apartment. They have access to listings that aren’t publicly available and can sometimes find cheaper listings than you can. The agents aren’t pushy like leasing people. They work on commission so they want you to find a listing you like, regardless of complex. Companies used in the past include:

- Zillow also has rentals from individually owned properties

## Neighborhoods

Here are some neighborhoods where grad students live or have lived:

- **North University**: walk to campus, can be expensive, quality & rent varies widely
- **Hyde Park & Hancock**: walk or bus to campus, decent public transport, generally nice neighborhoods with some crime on edges, quality & rent varies widely, avoid “Hyde Park Collective/CSC Management” property management.
- **West Hills**: Chill location with Colorado university apartments. Has HEB, Zilker, and the river nearby, bus to campus
- **Far West**: Larger apartments for similar prices, bus to campus. 
- **West Campus** (West of Guadalupe St, between MLK & 28th): mostly undergrads, safety concerns, **generally avoided**.
