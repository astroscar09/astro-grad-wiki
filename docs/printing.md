# Printing in the Department

Here we outline the way to connect to the printers in PMA.

To connect to the departmental printers, follow these steps:

1. Open the **UT Self Service** app on your computer.

2. In the app, locate and select "Install Printer".

3. Choose the appropriate printer based on your location:

    - ricoh16 – Ricoh printer on the 16th floor

    - laser16 – Laser printer on the 16th floor

    - laser15 – Laser printer on the 15th floor

4. Follow the on-screen installation instructions.

5. Once installed, you can print directly to the selected printer from any application.

If you encounter issues, feel free to reach out to the department IT support staff.
