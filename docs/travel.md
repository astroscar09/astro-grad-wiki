# Travel and Printing Posters 

## Order of Operations: 

1. Talk with your advisor to see if they have $ to send you to a conference, draft your poster/talk abstract, and calculate rough $ needed. 
2. Submit your abstract to a conference. Also see if the conference is offering any travel support, housing support, or fee waivers.
3. Fill out the <a href="https://utexas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6WOkvwgCUKKsFkp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Grad Travel Funding
</a> qualtrics form to apply for $ from your research group (& Grad Excellence fund, if available). Get the account code(s) & funding amount in an email from the professor responsible for the group funds. 
4. Get an account code (& funding amount if necessary) from your advisor. 
5. Fill out an <a href="https://www.as.utexas.edu/travel/rta_rfs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  RTA Form 
</a> at least 1 week before you travel, and specify which funds/accounts to use & if you want the travel office to book your flights. 
6. Go to the conference & save all travel/hotel receipts. If you are not requesting more than the per diem for food ($51/day), you don’t need to keep food receipts.  
7. Submit the <a href="https://www.as.utexas.edu/travel/reimburse_form.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  reimbursement form
</a> via email to travel@astro.as.utexas.edu. Remember to attach all required receipts. 
8. Reimbursements can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months to hit your bank account. You can use “Where’s My Check?” to see the status/printing date. 


## Reimbursements:
The travel office can pay for some travel expenses directly, and some travel expenses you have to pay out of pocket for and then wait to get reimbursed. This typically takes anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months after you submit your reimbursement form. The staff prioritize student reimbursements, but things can get held up if your advisor doesn’t have funds in the account they specified. 

Several of the staff on the 13th floor  currently help out travel arrangements, but our main travel person is Lauren Graves (email: <span style="color:#5dade2">lauren.graves@austin.utexas.edu</span>). The main email for UT Austin travel is <span style="color:#5dade2">travel@astro.as.utexas.edu</span>. 

### Things the travel office can pay for/book directly

- **Flights**: specify in your RTA what flights you want. If you need flights booked sooner rather than later, make sure to stay in contact with the travel office. If your flight gets canceled or you need to rebook a flight, do this through Anthony Travel (the company that the travel office uses) rather than rebooking yourself. 
- **Rental cars**: You can only get reimbursed for specific rental car companies, so it’s easier to get them to book this for you.
- **Conference Fees**: this gets difficult if the conference fee includes a banquet fee, which typically isn’t covered and comes out of your per diem unless you can prove it’s necessary :(

### Things you can get reimbursed

- **Hotels/lodging/accommodations** for the duration of the conference: 
    - Get an itemized receipt that shows the room rate and the tax separately. Don’t book through “pre-booking” websites like booking.com or agoda.com. Neither they nor the actual hotel cannot provide itemized receipts. 
    - The reimbursement limit is $275/person/day. 
    - If you’re staying in a hotel in Texas, ask the travel office how to book it to avoid state tax, which won’t get reimbursed. 
    - If you’re tacking on personal travel, you’re responsible for your own lodging beyond the days of the conference
- **Food** for the days of the conference + travel days: 
    - The per diem is typically $51/day regardless of where you are traveling, but this may go up depending on the type of grant you’re using & where you are travelling. Check with Lauren for specifics. 
    - You can get reimbursed above this amount if you have a good reason and you kept all of your receipts.
    - If the travel office knows that your conference provides certain meals, those meals will get deducted from your per diem (Breakfast $10, Lunch $15, Dinner $26). However, if you save your receipts, you can get full reimbursement. Example; the conference provided breakfast and lunch, and you paid ~$35 for dinner each night, save your dinner receipts to get reimbursed. 
- **Transportation** during the conference: flights, trains, rental cars, rideshares, public transport.
    - You’ll always need a receipt for it if you are traveling between one city and another. 
    - They only reimburse certain rental car companies. Check with them if you are booking a rental car yourself. 
    - You can add on days before or after your travel and still get your flights reimbursed. If the flight is centrally charged, they will find a “comparison flight” for conference-only travel. If you are booking the flight yourself, you need to send the receipt to the travel office within 24 hours of booking so they can find a comparison flight. If the comparison flight is more, you’ll pay the difference, otherwise it’s covered.
- **Poster printing** - need receipt
- **Mandatory international travel insurance** - need receipt

### Things you **cannot** get reimbursed
- **Conference banquets**, unless you can justify why the conference dinner was beneficial for business purposes. Folks have gotten it reimbursed by attaching a half page justification.
    - From Lauren:  Please attach a word document explaining the business purposes for this charge (ex: due to conference schedule couldn’t get away to purchase other food, opportunity for key collaboration with other attendees). 
- **Conference excursions**. Things like paid tours, wine tastings, etc.
- **Credit card interest** that accumulated as you waited for the reimbursement to hit your bank account.

**Advice**: If possible, try to build up your savings to ~$2,000 by your first summer (when travel may start) to avoid high credit card interest rates.
